This is a skeleton website created with [quarto](https://quarto.org/). I guess you may know GitHub much better than me, but just in case, you can download a zipped version of the this repository by clicking on the green button marked "Code" in the top-right bottom of the page. When the sliders opens, just click on "Download ZIP". Then you can extract locally and open the website. 

The folder [_site](_site) contains the rendered files in `html` and `js` etc. The main file is `_site/index.html`, which is the website homepage. 

The main `css` etc files are stored unde [_site/site_libs](_site/site_libs) --- I guess you would be able to navigate them and make a lot more sense of them than me...
